Abstract: Typical landing gears of small uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAV) limit their capability to land on vehicles moving at more than 20-50 km/h due to high drag forces, high pitch angles and potentially high relative horizontal velocities. To enable landing at higher speeds, a combination of lightweight friction shock absorbers and reverse thrust was developed. This allows for rapid descents (i.e., 3 m/s) toward the vehicle while leveling at the last instant. Simulations show that the proposed system is (1) more robust at higher descent speed contrary to traditional configurations, (2) can touchdown at almost any time during the leveling maneuver, thus reducing the timing constraints, and (3) is robust to many environmental, design and operational factors, maintaining a success rate above 80\% up to 100 km/h. Compared to standard multirotors, this approach expands the possible states envelope at touchdown by a factor of 60. A total of 38 experimental trials were conducted where a drone successfully landed on a pickup truck moving at speeds ranging from 10 to 110 km/h. The increased touchdown envelope was shown to improve the multirotors' robustness to external disturbances such as winds and wind gusts, sensor errors and unpredictable motion of the ground vehicle. The increased landing capabilities also expand the flight envelope at the start of the leveling maneuver by a factor of 38 compared to a standard multirotor, thereby allowing the drone to fly in tougher conditions and initiate its leveling maneuver from a broader range of altitudes, vertical and horizontal velocities, as well as pitch angles and rates.
