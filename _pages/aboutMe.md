Hello! I'm Isaac Tunney, a passionate developer and researcher. Welcome to my personal website where I share my projects and research.
I like to invent things that do not exist or that do exist but that do not perform/operate as it should.
I like to solve problems through creative thinking and fast prototyping.
One of my favorite parts of a project is the inital brainstorming creative phase where all ideas are accepted and explored, before converging towards a unique solution.
